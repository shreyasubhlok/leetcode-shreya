'''
Explanation of Each Part
1. Initialization: res is used to collect all subsets, and subset temporarily holds the current subset.
2. Backtracking Function backtrack(i):
   - Base Case: When i equals the length of nums, add a copy of the subset list to res.
   - Recursive Steps:
       Include Current Element: Add nums[i] to subset, call backtrack(i + 1) to explore further choices with this element included.
       Exclude Current Element: Remove nums[i] from subset using subset.pop(), then call backtrack(i + 1) to explore choices without the current element.
3.Result: After all calls complete, res contains every possible subset of nums.


Key Pointers to Remember
1. Include-Exclude Pattern: For each element, make two recursive calls â€“ one including it in the subset and one excluding it.
2. Backtracking after Adding: Add to the subset and backtrack, then remove it to backtrack properly.
3. Use Copy for Final Subsets: Always add a copy of subset to res to avoid modifications in later recursive calls.
4. Base Case Importance: Ensure that the base case correctly defines when to add the subset to res and end recursion.
