class Solution:
    '''
    Time Complexity: In the worst case, we might push up to k elements   into the heap, and each push/pop operation takes O(log k). 
So the time is approximately O(k log k). Thatâ€™s a big improvement over the naive O(nm log(nm)).
Space Complexity: O(k) for the heap and O(k) for the result array and visited set, giving us overall O(k).
